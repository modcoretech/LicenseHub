                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    A project license is a legal instrument that governs the use, modification, and distribution of creative works, including software, art, music, text, and other intellectual property. It defines the permissions granted by the creator to others, as well as any conditions or limitations that must be adhered to. Choosing the right license is crucial for protecting your work and enabling others to use it in ways you approve.

                            These licenses typically allow users to freely use, modify, and distribute software. They are broadly categorized into "permissive" and "copyleft" licenses.
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 text-gray-400">
                                <li><strong>Permissive Licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD):</strong> Grant extensive rights with minimal restrictions, primarily requiring attribution. They allow proprietary derivatives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Copyleft Licenses (e.g., GPL, LGPL, AGPL):</strong> Require that derivative works also be licensed under the same or a compatible open-source license, ensuring that the software remains "free." Strong copyleft (GPL, AGPL) applies to the entire work, while weak copyleft (LGPL, MPL) applies more narrowly, often to the licensed component itself.</li>

                            Creative Commons provides a suite of public licenses that allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve and which rights they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators. They are built on a "some rights reserved" approach.

                                <li><strong>CC BY (Attribution):</strong> Allows others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.</li>
                                <li><strong>CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike):</strong> Allows others to remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.</li>

                                <li><strong>CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike):</strong> Allows others to remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.</li>
                                <li><strong>CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives):</strong> The most restrictive of the six main licenses, allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.</li>
                                <li><strong>CC0 (Public Domain Dedication):</strong> Waives all copyright and related rights, effectively placing the work in the public domain.</li>

                            Font licenses dictate how a typeface can be used. These can vary significantly, from free for personal use to requiring commercial licenses for broader applications, embedding, or web use. Always check the specific terms of a font license.
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 text-gray-400">
                                <li><strong>Open Font License (OFL):</strong> A free, libre and open source license for fonts. It permits fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. It's common for Google Fonts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Desktop Licenses:</strong> For installing on a computer for design work.</li>
                                <li><strong>Webfont Licenses:</strong> For embedding fonts on websites using @font-face.</li>
                                <li><strong>App/E-book Licenses:</strong> For embedding fonts within applications or e-books.</li>

                            These licenses are typically used for proprietary software or content sold commercially. They are highly restrictive, only granting specific rights (e.g., installation, limited use) and often come with an End User License Agreement (EULA). Redistribution, modification, and reverse engineering are almost always prohibited.
