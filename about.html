                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    A project license is a legal instrument that governs the use, modification, and distribution of creative works, including software, art, music, text, and other intellectual property. It defines the permissions granted by the creator to others, as well as any conditions or limitations that must be adhered to. Choosing the right license is crucial for protecting your work and enabling others to use it in ways you approve.

                            These licenses typically allow users to freely use, modify, and distribute software. They are broadly categorized into "permissive" and "copyleft" licenses.

                                <li><strong>Permissive Licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD):</strong> Grant extensive rights with minimal restrictions, primarily requiring attribution. They allow proprietary derivatives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Copyleft Licenses (e.g., GPL, LGPL, AGPL):</strong> Require that derivative works also be licensed under the same or a compatible open-source license, ensuring that the software remains "free."</li>

                            Creative Commons provides a suite of public licenses that allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve and which rights they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators. They are built on a "some rights reserved" approach.
